preferred component usage:

1) create unlinked components

2) connect components togethers. includes:
	
		- view model (+ analyzers)
		- model (providers)
		
	view can embeded own drawers

3) constructors should have no parameters (NO DI here !)

	- methods should allow to setup components

	- code might adapt components even if already configured
		(eg: fft bars count) -> chain should not be recreated
		most complicated: implies to popagate shared settings into the chain

	  or else ? we have tp recreate components with new settings and rebuild chain

	  attachment methods (attachTo) can be substituted by property setter

	  composite view models construct sub view models themselves

	  avoid privates fields - they better be exposed even if not modifiable
	  (extensiblity) except if it concernes implementation details
